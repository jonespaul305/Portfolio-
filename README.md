📌 About The Project

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a modern and responsive design.

The website includes smooth animations, typing effects, active navigation highlighting, and a working contact form using EmailJS.
